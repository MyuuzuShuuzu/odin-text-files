Foundations: Computer Basics

1. Is Windows an operating system or an application?
Windows is an operating system.

2. What's the difference between open source and closed source software?
With open source software, the source code is publicly available to anyone
who wants it. Programmers can erad or change that code if they want.
With closed-source software, the public is not given access to the source
code, so they can't see or modify it in any way.

3. What are some use cases of a screenshot?
A screenshot can be used to capture an error message to show tech support.
If you're on the phone with someone who can't find something on their own
computer, you can send a screenshot of your computer to show that person
what to look for. Finally, you can also do something like saving the
confirmation number of a purchase rather than printing it or writing it down.

4. Give an example of a weak and a strong password?
One example of a weak password is w3St!. A strong password would be something
like m#P52s@ap$V.
