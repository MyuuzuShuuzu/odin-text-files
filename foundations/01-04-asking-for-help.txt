Foundations: Asking For Help

1. Name at least one thing your question should always include.
When asking a question, your question should include the relevant code snippet and its surrounding context.
You should also be asking about the problem, and not the solution.

2. Describe the “XY Problem.”
The XY problem begins when a user who wants to do one thing actually asks about doing another thing,
thinking they can engineer a solution from there. However, they don’t know how to do the second thing.
When other people try to help, they are confused since the second thing is a weird problem to solve.
After a lot of wasted time, the user eventually admits that they want to do the first thing,
and that the second thing wouldn’t have even helped.

3. Describe three attributes of a “help vampire.”
First, a help vampire asks repetitive, samey, incoherent questions very quickly, and he cannot properly
Google for the answers. He assumes that answering his question should be your utmost priority,
and he believes you should prove why he should do a certain thing. He’s usually waiting for someone else
to think for him, as he wants to have someone else to do all of his work; he doesn’t care that much about
getting the question answered.
