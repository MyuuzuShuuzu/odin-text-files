Git Basics: Git Basics

1. How do you create a new repository on GitHub?
Click the "+" button in the top right of the webpage and select "New repository."

2. How do you copy a repository onto your local machine from GitHub?
When you're in the repository on GitHub, click the green "Code" button and select
an option from HTTPS, SSH, and GitHub CLI, then copy the line below it. To actually
clone it onto your local machine, use git clone followed by the URL.

3. What is the default name of your remote connection?
The default name of your remote connection is "origin."

4. Explain what origin is in git push origin main.
"origin" is a placeholder name for the URL of the remote repository. You can use it
instead of the full URL to access the remote repository. You can also have multiple
remotes for a repository by giving each a unique name.

5. Explain what main is in git push origin main.
"main" is the branch of the remote repository you want to push your branch to. It is the
official branch in the your projects where production-ready code lives.

6. Explain the two-stage system that Git uses to save files.
A save in Git is divided into add and commit. Staging allows you to select which files
and repositories to place on your branch. Commiting is when you actually place them.
The respective commands are:
$ git add
$ git commit

7. How do you check the status of your current repository?
$ git status

8. How do you commit the files in the staging area and add a descriptive message?
$ git commit -m <Your message here>

9. How do you push your changes to your repository on GitHub?
$ git push
or
$ git push origin main

10. How do you look at the history of your previous commits?
$ git log
