# The Odin Project Text Files

All of my answers to each section's Knowledge Checks are located here.

The format of an entry after navigating into the correct subfolder is
as follows:
`xx-xx-title-of-lesson.txt`
- The first xx is the overall chapter number, starting from 01.
- The second xx is the lesson number, starting from 01.
- title-of-lesson is the lesson's title written in kebab-case.
- Each file is currently in .txt format, so just plain text.

Sometimes I may go back and reformat old files, change the names
around, or create new files if The Odin Project adds another lesson.
