Foundations: Introduction To Git

1. What kind of program is Git?
Git is a version control system.

2. What are the differences between Git and a text editor in terms of what they save and their record keeping?
A text editor saves everything in a document as a single file. You are only given one record of the file unless
you make duplicate copies. Saving in Git records differences in files and folders and keeps a historical record
of each save.

3. Does Git work at a local or remote level?
Git works on a local level.

4. Does GitHub work at a local or remote level?
GitHub works at a remote level on the web.

5. Why is Git useful for an individual developer?
You can track the history of every single change to a file. You can also see the before and after of a file,
along with context and descriptions of each change.

6. Why are Git and GitHub useful for a team of developers?
A version control system can easily and quickly bring multiple changes to the same or adjacent files together.
It will merge multiple versions of edited files into a usable state. The history also helps to see who worked
on what in each part of the project. Git and GitHub are great for facilitating collaboration.
